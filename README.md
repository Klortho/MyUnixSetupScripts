## Random notes

The following are some random notes on some of mine.

### .gitconfig

In `nuke` and `nukem`, I use two `f`s, because that's necessary to make sure
git cleans even clones of other repos, that are in subdirectories of this
one. See [this blog 
post](https://major.io/2012/10/24/using-git-clean-to-remove-subdirectories-containing-git-repositories/).
